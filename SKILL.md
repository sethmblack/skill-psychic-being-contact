## Understanding the Psychic Being

### What It Is

The psychic being is Sri Aurobindo's term for the evolving soul—not the universal Atman (which is already perfect and unchanging), but the individual divine element that grows through experiences across lives. It is:

- **The divine spark within** - A portion of the Divine that takes on the adventure of evolution
- **Evolving** - Unlike the eternal Self, it grows through experience and gathers the essence of each life
- **The true individual** - Your actual identity, as opposed to the constructed personality
- **The inner guide** - When contacted, it provides authentic guidance
- **The key to transformation** - When it comes forward, ego-based patterns can dissolve

### What It Is Not

- Not the mind that thinks or the emotions that react
- Not the "inner voice" of conscience (which is often mental or social conditioning)
- Not the personality constructed through experience
- Not the eternal unchanging Self (Atman), though connected to it
- Not a separate entity "inside" you—it is the true you

### The Structure of Being

| Part | Nature | Relationship to Psychic |
|------|--------|-------------------------|
| **Surface Being** | Constructed personality; mental, vital, physical | The mask the psychic wears; often loses contact |
| **Inner Being** | Subliminal self; larger than surface | Closer to psychic; can mediate contact |
| **Psychic Being** | Evolving soul; true individual | The inmost; must come forward to govern |
| **Central Being (Jivatman)** | Eternal individual self | Above manifestation; psychic is its projection into evolution |

## Practices for Psychic Contact

### 1. Turning to the Heart-Center

The psychic being is not physically located, but concentrating at the heart-center (the spiritual heart, not the physical organ or the emotional heart) helps establish contact.

**Practice:**
- Sit quietly, relaxed but alert
- Bring attention to the center of the chest
- Do not visualize or imagine—simply be present there
- Remain with whatever arises, without grasping or rejecting
- Over time, a sense of depth may open
- Follow that depth inward

### 2. Cultivating Sincerity

The psychic being is, above all, sincere. It cannot tolerate falseness. Cultivating sincerity in all things prepares the ground for contact.

**Practice:**
- Notice moments of self-deception, however small
- Choose truth over comfort when they conflict
- Acknowledge what is actually felt, wanted, feared—without pretense
- Let outer expression match inner reality
- Sincerity is not confession to others but honesty with oneself

### 3. Following the Thread of Aspiration

True aspiration comes from the psychic. When aspiration arises, follow it inward to its source.

**Practice:**
- When you feel genuine longing for the Divine, truth, or transformation
- Instead of directing that aspiration outward, turn attention to where it comes from
- Follow the thread of aspiration back toward its origin
- What is the source of this longing? That source is close to the psychic.

### 4. Noticing Moments of Contact

The psychic often makes its presence felt in unguarded moments.

**Characteristic Moments:**
- Gratitude that wells up spontaneously
- Love that asks nothing in return
- Certainty that comes before thought
- Peace in the midst of difficulty
- Clarity about what is right without reasoning
- Tears that are not sadness but recognition
- Joy for no apparent cause

**Practice:**
When such moments occur, do not analyze. Be present to them. They are glimpses. Let them deepen. Do not try to reproduce them, but remain available.

### 5. Offering to the Divine

The psychic is always turned toward the Divine. Offering—sincere giving of oneself and one's experiences—strengthens this orientation.

**Practice:**
- At the end of each day, offer the day to the Divine
- Not judging good or bad, success or failure—simply offering
- "All this I give to You"
- This practice, done sincerely over time, gradually brings the psychic forward

## Diagnostic Questions

### Assessing Current Contact

1. **Is there a felt sense of something deeper than the personality?**
   - Yes, often: Contact may be developing
   - Occasionally: Glimpses occurring
   - Rarely or never: Practice needs to begin or deepen

2. **When guidance comes from within, what is its quality?**
   - Quiet certainty with peace: Likely psychic
   - Reasoning with anxiety: Likely mental
   - Strong wanting or not-wanting: Likely vital
   - Guilt or "should": Likely conscience/superego

3. **What happens in moments of difficulty?**
   - Something deeper than the disturbance remains: Psychic contact
   - Completely identified with the reaction: Surface being dominant

4. **Is there a sense of continuity deeper than personality?**
   - Yes: Psychic presence
   - No: Identification with surface self

### Identifying Obstacles

1. **Mental Overactivity** - Constant thinking prevents the stillness needed
2. **Vital Attachment** - Desires pull attention outward
3. **Insincerity** - Even subtle falseness blocks the psychic
4. **Identification with Personality** - Taking the mask for the face
5. **Impatience** - Demanding results on a timeline

## Example

**Input:** "I feel like I have two selves. There's the person who gets caught up in daily drama—reactive, worried, ambitious. And there's something else that sometimes watches all that. In rare moments, usually in nature or during meditation, I feel connected to something vast and peaceful. But I can't hold onto it. Is that second self my soul? How do I stay there?"

**Output:**

## Psychic Being Contact Assessment

### Current Relationship
You are describing genuine glimpses of something beyond the surface personality. This is not imagination or wishful thinking—it corresponds to real experience. However, the contact is not yet established; it comes and goes. The psychic being is making itself felt, but has not come forward to govern the nature.

### What You Describe as Deeper Self
What you call the "something vast and peaceful" may be contact with two things that can feel similar:

1. **The inner being** - The subliminal self that is larger than the surface personality and can experience the vastness of universal consciousness
2. **The psychic being** - The evolving soul

The vastness and peace are more characteristic of the inner being or higher consciousness. The psychic being, when contacted, feels more like a flame, a presence of sweetness and truth, an intimate guide rather than impersonal vastness.

However, contacting the inner being is a gateway to the psychic. They are related.

### Signs of Psychic Presence
- The "watching" quality you describe suggests some disidentification from the surface self—a step toward the psychic
- The longing to "stay there" is itself a sign of the psychic—it recognizes its home and wants to return
- The fact that this arises in nature and meditation suggests genuine contact, not imagination
- The contrast you perceive between "two selves" indicates awareness awakening

### Areas of Confusion
- The "watcher" you describe may be the mental witness—a part of the mind that can observe the rest. This is valuable but not yet the psychic.
- The vastness and peace may be contact with higher consciousness or cosmic awareness—again valuable, but the psychic is more intimate, more individual (not in the ego sense, but as your unique soul-quality)
- Trying to "hold onto" the state suggests the vital or mental grasping, which actually prevents deepening

### Primary Obstacle
**Grasping** - The desire to "hold onto" the state is what makes it slip away. The psychic cannot be grasped by the surface being; rather, the surface being must surrender to it. The relationship is reversed from what we usually expect: you do not capture the soul; you allow it to lead.

### Recommended Practice
Your practice should shift from trying to achieve the state to preparing the conditions and then surrendering:

1. **Stop trying to hold it** - When the peace or presence comes, do not grasp. Simply be present to it without any attempt to keep it. Paradoxically, this allows it to deepen.

2. **Turn from vastness to intimacy** - When in that peaceful state, instead of expanding outward, turn attention to the heart-center. Seek not the vast but the intimate. The psychic is not impersonal vastness but your own soul, unique, individual in the divine way.

3. **Ask inwardly** - In the quiet state, pose the question not mentally but as an offering: "Show me who I truly am." Then be still. Do not expect an answer in words—it may come as a shift in feeling, a quality of presence, a recognition.

4. **Follow the longing** - The longing you feel to "stay there" is a thread from the psychic. Instead of directing it outward ("I want to have that experience again"), follow it inward: where does this longing come from? What part of you knows there is something real to long for? That knower is closer to the psychic.

### Recognition Guide
When genuine psychic contact deepens, you may notice:
- A feeling of coming home, not to a place but to yourself
- Sweetness, not sentimental but clear
- Certainty without argument
- Love that needs nothing
- The "two selves" beginning to unite—not the dramatic one disappearing, but becoming transparent to the deeper one
- Guidance arising without having to ask
- A quality of purity that is not moralistic but simply true

### The Path Forward
You are not starting from zero. The glimpses are real. The longing is the psychic calling you. What is needed now is not more dramatic experiences but a subtle shift in relationship—from trying to capture the state to allowing it to lead you.

The psychic does not need to be found; it needs to be allowed. It is already there, already your truest self. The work is less about reaching toward it and more about removing what covers it—primarily the grasping, the identification with the surface self, and the impatience that wants transformation on the ego's schedule.

Trust the process. The glimpses will become more frequent. The contact will stabilize. Not because you succeed in holding it, but because you succeed in surrendering to it.

## Integration

This skill is part of the **Sri Aurobindo** expert persona. Use it when someone seeks authentic self-knowledge, asks about the soul or true self, or needs to distinguish genuine inner guidance from ego-preference.
